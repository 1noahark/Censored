# About
A project I made to **refresh** my js knowledge 

# What it does

it replaces words (specific word) with a censoring star (*) in short it uses a regex process (find and replace process) and it censores that word you want to censor.

# Future Updates

1. censoring multiple word will come
2. you can you a censoring icon instead of only star


# Bugs
